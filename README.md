We hope that you find the software and documentation useful.
If you publish an analysis using the toolbox, we ask that you cite us. 
We are currently preparing on a publication to submit to peer review. 
For now, please cite our BioRxiv preprint:

# External Dependencies

The code in the toolbox depends on the functionality supplied by [LIBSVM](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) and it's specialised and often faster cousin, [LIBLINEAR](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/).
These libraries are included in releases from v1.0 onwards.
In some cases you may need to configure MATLAB to use these external dependencies.
Please see their respective documentation for more information.
